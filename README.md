# Rubiks-Cube-Solver

This project is a Rubik's Cube solver, where the intent is that the user will be able to hold up their mixed cube to their webcam and the solution will be presented to them. The motivation was to use this as an opportunity to practice application of basic computer vision and convolutional neural networks (CNN's).
